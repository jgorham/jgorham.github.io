I completed my Ph.D. in statistics in June 2017 at <a
href="https://statistics.stanford.edu/">Stanford University</a>, advised by
<a href="http://web.stanford.edu/~lmackey/">Lester Mackey</a> and <a
href="http://statweb.stanford.edu/~candes/"> Emmanuel Candes</a>. Earlier, I
received my B.S. (with honors) in mathematics from Stanford in 2010 and my
undergraduate advisor was <a href="http://www.matthewkahle.org/">Matthew
Kahle</a>.  My doctoral dissertation was the 2017 winner of the <a
href="https://bayesian.org/project/savage-award/">Savage award</a> in theory
and methods.

My interests are in <b>scalable machine learning</b>, <b>convex
optimization</b>, <b>Stein's method</b>, and <b>data visualization</b>. I've
interned at the biotech firm <a href="https://www.counsyl.com/">Counsyl</a>, worked as a <a
href="https://research.facebook.com/datascience/">data scientist at
Facebook</a>, and also worked as a data scientist at <a
href="https://www.opendoor.com/">Opendoor</a>. I am currently an ML eng at
<a href="https://whisper.ai/">whisper.ai</a>, where we're using statistics
and ML to power a new generation of hearing aids. I do not think there's a
best programming language, and I'm neither a frequentist nor a Bayesian. My
preference is for whatever works best!
