I completed my PhD in June 2017 from the <a href="https://statistics.stanford.edu/">Stanford statistics
department</a>, advised
by <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/~lmackey/">Lester Mackey</a>
and <a href="http://statweb.stanford.edu/~candes/"> Emmanuel Candes</a>. Earlier, I
received my B.S. (with honors) in mathematics from Stanford University in
2006 and my undergraduate advisor
was <a href="http://www.matthewkahle.org/">Matthew Kahle</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
My interests are in <b>scalable machine learning</b>, <b>convex
optimization</b>,
<b>Stein's method</b>, and <b>data visualization</b>. I've interned at
<a href="https://www.counsyl.com/">Counsyl</a> and also worked as
a <a href="https://research.facebook.com/datascience/">data scientist at
Facebook</a>. I do not think there's a best programming language, and I'm
neither a frequentist nor a Bayesian. My preference is for whatever works
best!
